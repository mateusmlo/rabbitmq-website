# The Homebrew RabbitMQ Formula

## <a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview">Overview</a>

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a popular package manager for macOS.
[RabbitMQ formula](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/r/rabbitmq.rb) is available from
Homebrews core tap (out of the box).

The formula will also install a recent [supported Erlang/OTP version](./which-erlang.html)
as a dependency.


## <a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation">Installation</a>

Before installing make sure the taps are up-to-date:

<pre class="lang-bash">
brew update
</pre>

Then, install RabbitMQ server with:

<pre class="lang-bash">
brew install rabbitmq
</pre>

Installing the RabbitMQ formula will install key dependencies such as a [supported Erlang/OTP version](./which-erlang.html).

## <a id="locations" class="anchor" href="#locations">Locations</a>

The RabbitMQ server scripts and [CLI tools](./cli.html) are installed into the `sbin` directory under `/usr/local/Cellar/rabbitmq/{version}/` for Intel Macs
or `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/rabbitmq/{version}/` for Apple Silicon Macs.

They should be accessible from `/usr/local/opt/rabbitmq/sbin` for for Intel Macs or `/opt/homebrew/opt/rabbitmq/sbin` for Apple Silicon Macs.
Links to binaries have been created under `/usr/local/sbin` for Intel Macs or `/opt/homebrew/sbin` for Apple Silicon ones.

To find out locations for your installation, use:

<pre class="lang-bash">
brew info rabbitmq
</pre>

With Homebrew, the node and CLI tools will use the logged in user account by default.


## <a id="managing-node" class="anchor" href="#managing-node">Running and Managing the Node</a>

Unlike some other installation methods, namely the [Debian](./install-debian.html) and [RPM packages](./install-rpm.html), RabbitMQ
Homebrew formula uses [generic UNIX binary builds](./install-generic-unix.html) and does not require `sudo`.

#### Starting the Server

To start a node in the foreground, run:

<pre class="lang-bash">
CONF_ENV_FILE="/opt/homebrew/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf" /opt/homebrew/opt/rabbitmq/sbin/rabbitmq-server
</pre>

To start a node in the background, use `brew services start`:

<pre class="lang-bash">
brew services start rabbitmq
</pre>

#### Stopping the Server

To stop a running node, use:

<pre class="lang-bash">
brew services stop rabbitmq
</pre>

or CLI tools directly:

<pre class="lang-bash">
/opt/homebrew/opt/rabbitmq/sbin/rabbitmqctl shutdown
</pre>

The command will wait for the node process to stop. If the target node is not running,
it will exit with a warning.

#### Configuring the Server

File and directory locations used by Homebrew differ from Intel Macs to Apple Silicon ones.
To find out locations for your installation, use:

<pre class="lang-bash">
brew info rabbitmq
</pre>

On Apple Silicon Macs, [RabbitMQ configuration file](configure.html#configuration-files) located at `/opt/homebrew/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf`.
The file does not exist by default and can be created.

It is possible to [use environment variables](configure.html#customise-general-unix-environment) to control certain settings.
`rabbitmq-env.conf` is located at `/opt/homebrew/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf`

See RabbitMQ [configuration guide](configure.html) to learn more.

## <a id="cli" class="anchor" href="#cli"></a>

The formula sets up links to CLI tools under `/usr/local/sbin` for Intel Macs or `/opt/homebrew/sbin` for Apple Silicon Macs.

In case that directory is not in `PATH`, it is recommended to append it:

<pre class="lang-bash">
# for macOS Intel
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sbin
# for Apple Silicon
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/homebrew/sbin
</pre>

Add the above export to the shell profile (such as `~/.bashrc` for bash or `~/.zshrc` for zsh)
to have `PATH` updated for every new shell, including OS restarts.
